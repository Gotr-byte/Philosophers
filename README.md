# Philosophers
A project related to threads from the 42 Curriculum. 
It is meant to simulate the problem of a group of philosophers sharing forks to eat spaghetti.
It is solved using threads and mutexes. Is a problem of sharing resources by several threads.
The threads are a kind of process that does not inherit all the resources of the parent process (correct me if I'm wrong on this).
The philosophers are threads, while the forks are resources. Each of them are sharing forks with their neighbour and need two to eat.
Each of them have spaghetti in front of them.
